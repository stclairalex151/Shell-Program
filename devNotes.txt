Program Description: 3207Project2

Attached is a copy of my shell program for 3207. This shell, in essence, prompts the user for input and handles a select number of internal commands. The shell also supports execution of files in current directory, as well as system calls handled by any linux terminal. With regards to design, the program uses an infinite while loop to prompt for commands. The program tokenizes the input from the user, sets appropriate flags (input redirection, output redirection, piping, and background execution. The shell then sorts the command based on its type (1 is internal, 2 is file in cwd, 3 is external command, and performs the appropriate action based on command type. My program handles all internal execution in one function (ExecInternal). Each command checks for flags, performs the operation, and reports back to the user for the next command. This program has a bug in the piping mechanism, and will not work properly. The background execution will report back to the shell 10 seconds after called, so that the shell gives the user a chance to run additional commands in the foreground. The parser was extensively tested and works with no known issues. It was tested independently by copying code to another file and testing in a loop. Additional testing was done using the #define DEBUG flag, but also caused errors at times when debug was set to 1. Background execution was extensively tested as well in the final stages of the program using various commands (both internal and external) and seems to work consistently. The only other known bug occurs when trying to re-write the current working directory, but this seems to not affect functionality of overall execution.
